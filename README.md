# NutriSenseViz
Jupyter Notebooks that create custom visualizations of the data exported from NutriSense.

# first-chart.ipynb
This notebook takes the exported data from NutriSense as input and produces a plotly chart for one day of glucose measurements.

# chart-one-day.ipynb
This notebook builds on first-chat.ipynb and produces a more advanced chart, that smoothes the data and also includes exercise and meal "events" that came with the data export from NutriSense.
